<h1>May 2018</h1>
<h2>2nd</h2>
<p>DH left some comments.</p>
<ol>
<li>Volatility persistency: See the second comment on April 23rd.</li>
<li>Sentiment correlation: Investors may overprice lotteries when their sentiment is high.</li>
<li>Catholic state: <a href=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2009.01483.x>Kumar (2009)</a> exhibits that (i) individual rather than institutional investors prefer lotteries more, and (ii) Catholic rather than non-Catholic investors prefer lotteries more.</li>
<li>Risky period: See the third comment on April 23rd.</li>
<li>Crisis return reversal: This is unclear, so must be clarified.</li>
<li>Fund (investor) choices: Past loser funds (investors) may hold or trade lotteries more to break even.</li>
</ol>
<p>DH also introduced <a href=https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/S0731-9053%282013%290000031007>one paper</a> about mixed-frequency VARs because existing firm-level news decomposition methods cannot dissect daily, weekly, or monthly stock returns as the methods involve accounting variables.</p>
<h1>April 2018</h1>
<h2>29th</h2>
<p><a href=/notebook/misc/180429whichvol.pdf>This</a> is the draft I submitted to the APAD conference. The due date for paper submission was today. The idea is clearer now, but I am still unconfident about my writing as I didn't have much time to revise it. It seems I can still overwrite what I uploaded, but it's uncertain.</p>
<p>I found <a href=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2974452>another working paper</a> that relates skewness preference and distress overpricing.</p>
<h2>25th</h2>
<p>Here is the paper DH mentioned yesterday. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2008.01416.x>Campbell, Hilscher, and Szilagyi (2008)</a> articulate that distressed firms are overpriced. They use accounting variables such as Altman's \(Z\) and Ohlson's \(O\) to classify distressed firms. Their findings contradict what Fama&ndash;French model conjectured&mdash;what \(SMB\) and \(HML\) capture may be the distress underpricing.</p>
<h2>24th</h2>
<p>DH said that there are some researchers who relate the volatility anomaly to a distress preference. The researchers argue that investors regard stocks of distressed firms as unscratched lottery tickets and correspondingly overvalue them despite of their poor expected returns. It's reasonable at a glance as overcoming financial distress signals something positive with which a stock price surges up, but a little bit blurry as it employs a corporate finance rationale (if distressed) to account for an asset pricing phenomenon (if skewed). Who are these researchers?</p>
<h2>23rd</h2>
<p><a href=/notebook/misc/180410whichvol.pdf>This</a> is the draft I submitted to Lubar School on April 10th. I sent it to Val to get some comments at that time and he sent me some feedback on April 13th. Roughly, he said that I should display some findings that weed out alternative explanations and narrow down the possibilities.</p>
<p>After receiving the comments, I tried to clearly state what I've done so far and the things I can do to further develop the paper. <a href=/notebook/misc/180419whichvol.pdf>This</a> is what I presented to Val and DH on April 19th and 20th, respectively. Their responses were not bad. Here are DH's comments.</p>
<ol>
<li>For the arbitrage portfolios, the alpha returns at \(t-11\), \(\cdots\), \(t-1\), \(t+1\), \(\cdots\), \(t+11\) as well as those at \(t\) should be reported.</li>
<li>Are the volatilities persistent? Let's check using a transition matrix or something.</li>
<li>Do momentum crashes (momentum due to underreaction when VIX is low, but reversal due to overreaction when VIX is high) exist? One can confirm the phenomena by estimating the average and alpha returns annually.</li>
<li>The degree of skewness preference can vary over time. Do the average and alpha returns change as consumer and investor indices change?</li>
<li>Are the findings robust? There is another decomposition method suggested by <a href=https://doi.org/10.1093/rfs/hht005>Chen, Da, and Zhao (2013)</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>And here are Val's comments.</p>
<ol>
<li>Roughly, there can be four volatilities, i.e. systematic and idiosyncratic volatilities of cash flow and discount rate shocks, respectively. It's reasonable for cash flow shocks to have idiosyncratic volatilities as investors frequently revise their expectation about future dividends, but do they often adjust corresponding discounts? Aren't the discount rate shocks systematic in nature? There should be a supporting example that shows the idiosyncratic discount rate shocks to bolster the motivation.</li>
<li>Let's assume anyway that there exist idiosyncratic discount rate shocks. Does the decomposition method correctly identify cash flow and discount rate shocks and corresponding volatilities? What if there is a measurement error problem?</li>
</ol>
<p>DH recommended me to submit the draft to the APAD conference, but I am unsure concerning the quality of this draft.</p>
