<h2>April 2018</h2>
<h3>23th</h3>
<p><a href=/notebook/miscellany/180410whichvol.pdf><span>This</span></a> is the draft I submitted to Lubar School on April 10th. I sent it to Val to get some comments at that time and he sent me some feedback on April 13th. Roughly, he said that I should display some findings that weed out alternative explanations and narrow down the possibilities.</p>
<p>After receiving the comments, I tried to clearly state what I've done so far and the things I can do to further develop the paper. <a href=/notebook/miscellany/180419whichvol.pdf><span>This</span></a> is what I presented to Val and DH on April 19th and 20th, respectively. Their responses were not bad. Here are DH's comments.</p>
<ol>
<li>For the arbitrage portfolios, the alpha returns at \(t-11\), \(\cdots\), \(t-1\), \(t+1\), \(\cdots\), \(t+11\) as well as those at \(t\) should be reported.</li>
<li>Are the volatilities persistent? Let's check using a transition matrix or something.</li>
<li>Do momentum crashes (momentum due to underreaction when VIX is low, but reversal due to overreaction when VIX is high) exist? One can confirm the phenomena by estimating the average and alpha returns annually.</li>
<li>The degree of skewness preference can vary over time. Do the average and alpha returns change as consumer and investor indices change?</li>
<li>Are the findings robust? There is another decomposition method suggested by Chen, Da, and Zhao (2013).</li>
</ol>
<p>And here are Val's comments.</p>
<ol>
<li>Roughly, there can be four volatilities, i.e. systematic and idiosyncratic volatilities of cash flow and discount rate shocks, respectively. It's reasonable for cash flow shocks to have idiosyncratic volatilities as investors frequently revise their expectation about future dividends, but do they often adjust corresponding discounts? Aren't the discount rate shocks systematic in nature? There should be a supporting example that shows the idiosyncratic discount rate shocks to bolster the motivation.</li>
<li>TEXT</li>
</ol>
<p>DH recommended me to submit the draft to the APAD conference, but I am unsure about the quality of this draft.</p>

<h3>22th</h3>
<p>This note is initiated. \(\mathrm{\LaTeX}\) grammar is available. For example,
\[y_i=\alpha+\beta x_i+\varepsilon_i.\]</p>
